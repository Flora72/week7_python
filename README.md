# Week 7: Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

Welcome to **Week 7** of the Python journey. This project explores data analysis using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, with a focus on clarity, structure, and emotional resonance in visual storytelling.

---

## Project Overview

This script (`index.py`) demonstrates:

- Reading and cleaning datasets using `pandas`
- Visualizing trends with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Practicing modular, readable code for data workflows
- Building emotional clarity into plots and labels

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following packages are installed in your Python 3.13 environment:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

If you're using a virtual environment:

```bash
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure

```plaintext
week7/
├── index.py              # Main script for data analysis and visualization
├── data.csv              # (Optional) Sample dataset used in the script
├── README.md             # Project documentation
└── assets/               # (Optional) Folder for saved plots or visuals
```

---

## How to Run

```bash
python3 index.py
```

On first run, `matplotlib` may build a font cache,this is normal and only happens once.

---

## Visualization Philosophy

Each plot is designed to:

- Feel emotionally clear and intentional
- Use color and spacing to guide the viewer gently
- Center the story behind the data, not just the numbers

---

## Notes

- If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensure all dependencies are installed and your environment is clean.
- For font or rendering issues, delete the `~/.cache/matplotlib` folder and rerun the script.
